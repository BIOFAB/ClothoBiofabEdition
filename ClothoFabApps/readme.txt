****Instructions for Building the ClothoFab version of Clotho****
You should have already pulled down (by SVN):
     https://clothocad.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/clothoapps/trunk/ClothoFabApps
     https://clothocad.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/clothocad/trunk/ClothoProject
     https://clothocad.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/clothocad/trunk/ClothoApps
     https://clothocad.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/clothocad/trunk/ClothoDevelopment

You should be able to open ClothoProject into Netbeans (6.9.1 or higher) now and
compile it as described on the Build instructions of the Clotho Wiki.

Now we will convert it into the Fab version of Clotho by enabling the Windows API
(and other things) and changing which modules are associated with the project.
