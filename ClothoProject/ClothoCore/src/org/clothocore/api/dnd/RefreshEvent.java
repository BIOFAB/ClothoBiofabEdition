 * RefreshEvents are passed during data listening events.  The event
 * refers to any change anywhere in an ObjBase, but the details of
 * what changed are contained within an enumeration (the Condition) of
 * the RefreshEvent.  Because of this, you can make more specific changes
 * in GUI than drawing everything about an ObjBase.  If this is too
 * complicated, though, you can just refresh the whole GUI and then
 * not have to worry about RefreshEvents at all.
